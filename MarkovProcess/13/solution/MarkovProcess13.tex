\begin{problem}\label{pro:1}
  A radio is powered by one battery, the lifetime of the battery obey the distrubution of exponential distribution
  with parament \(\lambda = \frac{1}{30}\). In long term, in which frequence should we change the battery?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{pro:2}
  Consider a primitive renewing process with average renewing internal time \(\mu\). Assume every renewing time
  is recorded by probability \(p\), and each record and each renew are independence. Let \(N_r(t)\) be the
  times of renewing by recorded until time \(t\). \(\{N_r(t): t \geq 0\}\) is a renewing process or not?
  And calculate \(\lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{N_r(t)}{t}\).
\end{problem}
